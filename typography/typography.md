# Typography 

## Intro

- *Importance of Typography.* Hard to believe, typography holds 90% of the effectiveness of a grahic design. Why? 
1. Look and feel. Because the shape of the letters itself already communicates a message. For example, if you want to communicate a serious and conservative message you would use a serious and conservative font. If you want to communicate a friendly and fun message, you would use a friendly and fun font. 
2. Readability. Because a verval message needs to be communicated too. The piece you are going to design has text that it's going to be read by people. Readability (the ease with which text can be read and understood) is crutial in graphic design.  
3. Hierachy. Playing with different sizes, position, weights, etc.. of the font will allow us to stablish a hierarchy and allow readers to "scan" different levels of information depending on how interested they are, and they can digg in the content as they want. Like you do when you are reading a newspaper. If you don't have much time you may just ready the headlines of the newspaper. Then if you find one of those headlines very interesting you may read the highlights, so you have a bit more information about the article, without having to read the whoe article. If you are my dad, then you read the whole newspaper.  

- Choosing the type (anatomy of letter, history and classification)

- Treating the type (hierachy, kerning, leading, trecking etc.)
