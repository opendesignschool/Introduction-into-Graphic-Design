Introduction into Graphic Design
================================

Short introductory course of graphic design basics


# Introduction
- *What is Graphic design?* Graphic design is visual communication. Graphic Desigers are translators. Clients have a 'message' that needs to be visually communicated, and we traslate that message from verbal communication to visual communication. Brands are typically born from the founder personality and the things he/she/them believe in, witch are called brand values. For example, innocent drinks brand values are: be natural, be entrepreneurial, be responsible, be commercial and be generous. When we look at innocent drinks branding and packaging we can visually see all this brand values, witch means the graphic designers have done a great job translating those words given to them to visuall communication. 

- *Where does it come from?* It's difficult to give an exact birth date to graphic design as some may say it was on the stone age with the cave man, others will say it was with the illuminated manuscripts during the Middle Age, and others will say it was with Gutenberg's printing press. But when the contemporary definition of graphic design and visuall communication really starts is with the industrial revolution and the invention of branding in packaging. Before the industrial revolution, product producers were selling their products themselves, so as a costumer you always knew that product was made by that person and it was no need for branding. Once the industrial revolution started, products start beeing mass produced and selled by people who where not the makers any more. It was then when need for branding started. Consumers needed to differenciate from one chocolate bar to the other, to know witch one is the one they liked, since they were not buying it anymore from "Mr. John", but in a retail enviroment that sold more than one brand. So branding solves the problem of 'personality recognision'. For example, now we know if we buy a cadbury chocolate bar it's going to be: cheap, tasty, creamy, milky, etc... And we know if we buy a Lindt chocolate bar it's going to be:"made in Switzerland", premium, etc.. 

- *Difference between graphic design and art.* Two practices often considered the same, art and graphic design have some things in common, but a very different propose. Both use the visual lanuage to communicate a message. In the art world, the artist has a PERSONAL MESSAGE that wants to communicate to the rest of the world. In the other hand, the graphic desinger has a message given by someone else and he/she needs to visually communicate it. 

## Structure of the course

### Typography 

- *Importance of Typography.* Hard to believe, typography holds 90% of the effectiveness of a grahic design. Why? 
1. Look and feel. Because the shape of the letters itself already communicates a message. For example, if you want to communicate a serious and conservative message you would use a serious and conservative font. If you want to communicate a friendly and fun message, you would use a friendly and fun font. 
2. Readability. Because a verval message needs to be communicated too. The piece you are going to design has text that it's going to be read by people. Readability (the ease with which text can be read and understood) is crutial in graphic design.  
3. Hierachy. Playing with different sizes, position, weights, etc.. of the font will allow us to stablish a hierarchy and allow readers to "scan" different levels of information depending on how interested they are, and they can digg in the content as they want. Like you do when you are reading a newspaper. If you don't have much time you may just ready the headlines of the newspaper. Then if you find one of those headlines very interesting you may read the highlights, so you have a bit more information about the article, without having to read the whoe article. If you are my dad, then you read the whole newspaper.
