Introduction into Graphic Design
================================

Short introductory course of graphic design basics


# Introduction
- *What is Graphic design?* Graphic design is visual communication and Graphic Desigers are translators. Clients have a 'message' that needs to be visually communicated, and we traslate that message from verbal communication to visual communication. Brands are typically born from the founder personality and the things he/she/them believe in, witch are called brand values. For example, innocent drinks brand values are: be natural, be entrepreneurial, be responsible, be commercial and be generous. When we look at innocent drinks branding and packaging we can visually see all this brand values, witch means the graphic designers have done a great job translating those words given to them to visuall communication. 

- *Where does it come from?* It's difficult to give an exact birth date to graphic design as some may say it was on the stone age with the cave man, others will say it was with the illuminated manuscripts during the Middle Age, and others will say it was with Gutenberg's printing press. But when the contemporary definition of graphic design and visuall communication really starts is with the industrial revolution and the invention of branding in packaging. Before the industrial revolution, product producers were selling their products themselves, so as a costumer you always knew that product was made by that person and it was no need for branding. Once the industrial revolution started, products start beeing mass produced and selled by people who where not the makers any more. It was then when need for branding started. Consumers needed to differenciate from one chocolate bar to the other, to know witch one is the one they liked, since they were not buying it anymore from "Mr. John", but in a retail enviroment that sold more than one brand. So branding solves the problem of 'personality recognision'. For example, now we know if we buy a cadbury chocolate bar it's going to be: cheap, tasty, creamy, milky, etc... And we know if we buy a Lindt chocolate bar it's going to be:"made in Switzerland", premium, etc.. 

- *Difference between graphic design and art.* Two practices often considered the same, art and graphic design have some things in common, but a very different propose. Both use the visual lanuage to communicate a message. In the art world, the artist has a PERSONAL MESSAGE that wants to communicate to the rest of the world. In the other hand, the graphic desinger has a message given by someone else and he/she needs to visually communicate it.
